# Approximate Spectral Clustering with growing neural network

Approximate Spectral Clustering (ASC) with Growing Neural Network (GNG) is a clustering method.
The method partitions data points using the reference vectors and the network topology of the network generated from the data points by GNG
The detail of this method is described in [my manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07101).

- asc.py: main program
- gng.py: program of growing neural gas
